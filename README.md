# TB4 Simulation with Webots

Welcome to the `tb4_sim` repository! This project provides a basic simulation environment for the Turtlebot4 robot using the Webots simulator. Whether you're new to robotic simulations or a seasoned researcher, this repository is designed to provide a solid foundation to experiment and develop using Turtlebot4 in a virtual environment.

## Features:

1. **Turtlebot4 Model**: A detailed model of the Turtlebot4 robot to accurately mimic its real-world counterpart's behavior and characteristics.
2. **Webots Integration**: Leverages the power of Webots, a widely-used robot simulator, offering realistic physics and sensor models.
3. **Basic Environments**: Simple scenarios are included to get started with testing and experimentation.

## Prerequisites:

- Webots: Make sure you have [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) installed.
- ROS2 Humble

## Quick Start:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tb4_sim.git
```

2. **Launch the simulation**:
I have prepared a complete launcher: it launch the world, spawns the robot and interfaces it with the drivers. 

## Contributing:

Contributions are always welcome!

## Acknowledgments:

I would like to thank the Webots community for their extensive documentation and support, and the creators of Turtlebot4 for their open-source resources.

## Support & Feedback:

For any questions or feedback, please open an issue, I will get back to you as soon as possible.
